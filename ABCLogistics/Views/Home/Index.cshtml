        <h3>Next Steps &amp; Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One order can only contain one item. Ideally, one order should be able to contain many different items. This would require an independant Item table.</li>
            <li>A customer can only store one delivery address. Idealy the customer should be able to store a list of addresses and select which address a particular order should be delivered to.</li>
            <li>The admin cannot remove roles from a user, only add them. Idealy the admin should be able to use the interface to remove system roles from a user.</li>
            <li>Users cannot update their profile data after registration. Ideally this should always be available to be updated.</li>
